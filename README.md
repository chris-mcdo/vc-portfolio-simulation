From the report:

> Monte-Carlo simulation is used to evaluate the distribution
> of returns for portfolios of investments made at the seed stage.
> The results confirm that the main benefit of
> diversification is a higher typical (median) return multiplier.
> Under the simple model presented, gains from diversification
> reach diminishing returns at around 1000 firms for "early-exit"
> strategies, but continue to be substantial beyond this
> for "late-exit" strategies.
> Limitations of the model are briefly discussed.
